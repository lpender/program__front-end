  Front end development is the study of the languages, <a

    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"
    target="_blank">CSS</a> and <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript,
  </a>
  which are are parsed and executed by your web browser each time you visit a
  web page.

<p>
  If you're not already you should get very comfortable with the idea of
  "googling" that which you don't already know  Google is a great tool for
  learning new things--the ability to study documentation, articles and
  tutorials is the bedrock of being a developer.
</p>

<p>
  That said, things can often become overwhelming when synthesizing large
  amounts of information--a tutorial on the internet is, in all likelihood, not
  always a perfect fit to the actual problem at hand.  In these situations,
  nothing replaces the value of an actual human being, guiding you and
  explaining multiple, overlapping concepts as they come up in the natural flow
  of completing a project.  Your mentor has years of experience facing the same
  kinds of problems that you will be facing, and they will guide you through
  the toughest of times.
</p>

<p>
  The intention of this course is not to prescriptively step you through each
  and every thing that you will need to learn these languages.  For that type
  of experience, we recommend sites like <a
    href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeAcademy</a> or <a
    href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>.
</p>

<p>
  These sites are great, and we heartily recommend that you take the time
  to go through the tutorials they provide--but they won't fully prepare you
  for the experience of facing actual, on the job challenges.
</p>

<p>
  This course is going to push you to your limits, and you will have to work
  hard, but take heart: your mentor is an expert with years of experience in
  the business. They will be there to guide you through the toughest times--
  they are here to act not only as your mentor, but as your co-worker and, at
  times, your boss.
</p>

<p>
  And lest the tone here become too intimidating, buck up! This is going to be
  fun!  Solving problems and being creative are the meat and potatoes of
  coding, and, while they can be frustrating, there is little that can't be
  overcome with patience.  The most important thing for a coder is not to give
  up.  The rewards are great. Excellent job prospects for folks with front end
  skills aside, prepare to get used to the feeling of satsifaction that comes
  with overcoming obstacles, doing things that you <em>weren't sure you could
    do.</em>

<p>
  Before we dive into this program, I want you to take a moment and reiterate,
  for your mentor and for yourself, your motivation for wanting to learn front
  end development.
