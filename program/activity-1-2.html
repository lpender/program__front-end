  Front end development is the study of the languages, <a

  Before you start this course you should be very comfortable with the idea of
  "googling" something you don't know.  Where Google comes up short, your mentor
  will become an invaluable research.  But the intention of this course is not
  to prescriptively step you through each and every thing that you will need to
  learn these languages.  For that type of experience, we recommend sites like
  <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeAcademy</a> or <a
    href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>.
</p>

<p>
  These sites are invaluable, and we heartily recommend that you take the time
  to go through the tutorials they provide--but we believe that nothing will
  prepare you for the experience of becoming a front end developer like facing
  real challenges, as if you had a real job.  This course is going to push you
  to your limits, and you will have to work hard, but take heart: your mentor
  is an expert with years of experience in the business. They will be there to
  guide you through the toughest times.

  And lest the tone here become too intimidating, buck up! This is going to be
  fun!  Solving problems and being creative are the meat and potatoes of
  coding, and, while they can be frustrating, all they require is patience.
  A good coder can work on the same problem for hours without getting bored--
  and the rewards are great. Prepare to get used to the feeling of satsifaction
  that comes with overcoming obstacles, doing things that you <em>weren't sure
    you could do.</em>

  Before we dive into this program, I want you to take a moment and reiterate,
  for your mentor and for yourself, your motivation for wanting to learn front
  end development.
</p>

<p>
  I welcome you, grasshopper, to the world of front end development! Let the games
  begin!
