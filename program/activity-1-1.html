  Welcome, grasshopper, to the world of front end web development.
</p>

<p>
  Take a moment to do a cursory search for "front end intern".  How many
  positions are available within ten miles of where you live? How many more
  positions are available "remote"? (That means working from home).
</p>

<p>
  Web developers are among the most sought after on the job market.  And front
  end development is the classic "gateway" to web development.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have learned basic front end, a nearly endless, branching, pathway of
  careers opens to you.  If you're of the more logical persuasion, you could
  learn about the backend and become a full-stack developer.  If trigonometry
  or design intrigues you more, you can enter the study of user-experience and
  user interfaces.
</p>

<p>
  Don't get me wrong, you can stick with front-end development as well!  That,
  on it's own, is a subject deep enough to have it's own bevvy of experts, it's
  own prestige.
